# jdbc-project

First, you have to create a database called **jdbc_project** and import the *projet.sql* into it.
Then go to the **data.txt** file, replace **root** by your username and add your password on the third line if needed.
You can now launch the app

Once the app is launched, you can : 
1.  log in, check the existing account via the database or the employee zone 
2.  sign in, open a new frame in wich you'll enter the requested data
3.  enter without logging to chose the movie you wanna watch
4.  reach the employee zone. In order to do so, you have to enter ***salut*** as password when clicking on the employee button
